# DialoGPTEliza
This repo contains the source code for an Eliza-like chatbot developed as part of an NLP and ML course in 2022. The project utilizes transfer learning with DialoGPT to create a modern Eliza trained on dialog from The Big Bang Theory and responses from the original Eliza. Rather than using predefined rules, this chatbot is data-driven.
